## Getting Started
> - Have you forked the repo from the LearningFuze account?
        - **Yes** - continue to next step
        - **No** - Fork from the Learningfuze Repo to your account
        - **I don't know** - Look at **your** github account and see if you can find the appropriate repo there.

        - **I don't know** - type `pwd` and press enter.  If you don't see the right folder, use `cd [folder name]` till you get to the right folder.  Use `cd ..` to go backwards a step in your folder structure, if necessary.
